* Introduction
  This are reflections on our current society.

* Annihilation of Caste
  These are some of the [[./annihilation-of-caste.org][jottings]] I made while reading the
  book, Annihilation of Caste by B.R. Ambedkar.  This is not
  not done yet, but a work in progress.

* Current Angst 
  Some [[./the-current-angst.org][perspectives]] I gained while interacting with my
  friends.  The problem is, a majority of us who have the
  privilege to lead a decent life atleast materially are
  loosing sight of how such a life be sustainable and
  available to all others.
