* Motivation
  
  It is a modest effort but a revolutionary one to connect
  the consumers directly to the farmers and their produce.
  This model would dissolve permanently some of the
  inveterate problems facing a consumer: access to quality
  produce; and facing a farmer: a remunerative price.  Also
  a myriad bunch of benefits would accrue both to the farmer
  and the consumer.

* At a Glance
  - Variety: Banginapalli (Benishaan)
  - Box Weight: 5 kg, (~ 18 to 22 mangoes)
  - Price: Rs 500
    
* Place your order
  The boxes are in 5kg and 10 kg, I have listed in the form
  only 5 kg boxes, please select multiples of 5 according to
  your convenience.  Upon delivery, I will take the
  payment.  My upi id is 9490448747@upi.

* Plan
  I will be harvesting as the fruit is ripening on the tree
  in batches of one tonne in the next few weeks. Each box is
  packed with hay inside to allow for further ripening. Each
  5kg box costs Rs 500/-, i.e., Rs 100 /kg. The produce is
  totally organic. This farm never used chemical
  fertilizers. The land was fallow before we planted mango
  saplings. This is the third year of harvest. Last year the
  harvest is lost due to hailstorm. My email is
  travula@gmail.com and phone number is 9490448747.


* Benefits of buying from Coopious
  1. The mangoes are harvested only after they reach the
     ripening stage on the tree ensuring a sweet taste that
     eludes many that are procured from retail outlets in
     the city.

  2. Organically grown and naturally ripened.

  3. To be able to connect directly to the farmer and
     influence the way farming is carried out.  However
     radical the idea is, this could have profound
     implications in mitigating many of the bad practices in
     farming leading to healthy soil, nutritious and tasty
     produce and healthy consumers.  On the whole a road
     towards sustainable farming could be paved.


* COMMENT comment
   A simple scenario illustrating various players involved in moving a mango
   from an orchard to the dining table.  If we assume x be price of kilogram of
   mango that is determined at a market yard in an auction, the flow chart
   helps in visualizing the actual amount the farmer gets.  An average of Rs. 3
   /Kg is spent towards costs for harvesting and transporting his produce to
   the market yard.  An additional 10% of x (the price a wholesaler bids in
   open auction in market yard) is paid by the farmer to the agent who
   facilitates the transaction between the farmer and wholesaler at the market
   yard.  The net price that a farmer gets for a kilogram of mango is: x - 3 -
   x*10/100 = 0.9x - 3.  From my experience in the last 5 years, x varies
   anywhere between Rs. 7 and Rs. 12 depending on the amount of fruit coming to
   market yard during the peak season (end of April to early June).  This means
   a farmer makes anywhere between Rs. 4 and Rs. 7 a kilo.


* COMMENT Current Scenario and breaking the nexus

  From the above diagram one can clearly see it is just one step to move the
  produce from the field to the table of a consumer.  KissanDirect is one way of
  making this possible.  We can use technology that is available to remove
  redundancies and apprehensions.  The belief here is that if we can build the
  trust and tear away the veil of uncertainty between the actual people: the
  giver and the taker, a whole slew of benefits will accrue to both the
  players.

* COMMENT The Genesis of the Idea
  The idea to link the consumer and the producer came after listening to the
  experiences of one of my father's friends who lives in Hyderabad.  My father
  sent them a basket of mangoes from our farm in one of the previous years.  The
  following year, we could not send them mangoes for various reasons.  What she
  told us when we met her some time later is that all her efforts to find
  mangoes in the market that could match the taste of the mangoes from our farm
  had turned futile.  When we sent her again mangoes from our farm, we brought
  back the smile and satisfaction for that summer.  So, I thought would it not
  be possible to provide the produce from the farm with a quality that eludes
  the most in retail outlets across the city.

* About Me
I am tied to the idea "Small is Beautiful" and does farming
in my native village over the weekends.  I attribute most of
the problems that afflict us today to bigness.  I am also of
the firm belief that bigness takes away the connection
between man and nature and allows one to sheild from owning
responsiblity for the irreparable damage being done to
EARTH.

* Why does this happen?
  Agriculture is indeed not much different from child rearing.  The
  responsibility and the associated joy seem to be present in both the
  activities.  But in the prevailing conditions, does the farmer have the
  luxury to look at that way? The farmer has to wage a battle against high
  input costs, low prices for his produce, vagaries of the climate, to earn a
  decent livelihood.  Institutional support - banks, market places,
  co-operative societies, insurance policies - is either non existent or is
  being dismantled if any by the neoliberal policies being pursued by the
  government.  This leaves the farmer in a desperate situation forbidding any
  joy in his profession and in the process forcing him to adopt various
  unsustainable methods in the hope of staying afloat the wrecked ship - the
  agriculture.  The only choice left before the farmer to offset the high input
  costs and low output prices is to raise the output.  The farmer without
  realizing enters into a vicious cycle: to increase the output, he applies
  higher doses of fertilizer, pesticides thereby increasing the input costs and
  in the process agriculture is re-laid on the lines of factory production.
  The practices would increase production in the short term but have
  deleterious affects in the long term.  Unlike in assembly line production,
  dependence of harvest on multiple factors - pests, rainfall, climate (modern
  agricultural practices are inadequate to ensure flowering and the ratio of
  flowers that would turn into fruit), etc - leaves a farmer moored to a
  mountain of debt.  This situation has forced an exodus from farming leaving
  only either the brave or for whom agriculture is the only option.  Our model
  here would alleviate the condition of the farmer by raising the output price.
  This would increase the number of factors to two - size of produce and price
  of produce - that a farmer can depend on for the viability of his profession
  and provide breathing space to rethink on the present practices of farming.

* The FUTURE 
  A new future hinges on the success of this initial
  offering of Coopious.  Coopious should enable all the
  entities in a supply chain to be cooperatives operating in
  a transparent manner.  Transparency should be the
  pre-requisite for any business and a consumers' right.
  For example, in a agriculture produce supply chain, we
  would have a farmers, processing, delivery and consumers
  cooperatives working together.  Therefore, it should be
  possible to:

  1. ensure the quality of produce as promised by the farmer
  2. provide mechanism for delivery to the consumer
  3. provide a barcode to the produce that a consumer buys which can hold
     information about:
     1. quality of the soil,
     2. nutritional level of the produce,
     3. the day of harvest,
     4. number of miles the produce traveled and other relevant information
        that a consumer deems necessary for him to make a qualified decision.
        
  Such information should enable a consumer to have all the
  information about each morsel of food that she eats.  On
  the production side cooperatives using Coopious platform
  can ensure the producer is the sole beneficiary by
  eliminating all the middlemen.  Small scale solar powered
  processing industries can be set in the villages to
  process the produce like milling rice or pulses,
  extracting oil form seeds.  These will not only provide
  employment in the villages but could transform the
  villages into cash rich self sustaining units that can
  finance building modern urban facilities like sewerage
  lines, water lines, proper schools, hospitals etc.

* COMMENT How does it work?
  An order can be placed for one or more baskets(units).  The mango variety is
  Banganpalli.  Each box will weigh 10 Kg (the number of mangoes will be between
  30 and 40).  The produce this year is down by 50-60% than last year therefore
  the price of mango is higher.  The price of each basket will be Rs. 250
  (10Kg * Rs. 25/Kg).  Once the orders reach 100 baskets, an e-mail will be
  dispatched that will tell the place for pickup.  Money can be paid upon the
  receipt of your basket of mangoes.  This time the order will not be delivered
  to your place since that would take a lot of logistical support, instead a
  place convenient (mostly nearer to the workplace) for pickup and the day of
  pickup will be mentioned.
